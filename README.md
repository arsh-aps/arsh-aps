## Hi there 👋 Welcome to My Github Repository!
### About Me
I am a 3rd year computer science student with a passion for creating programs that make people's daily lives easier. I have experience in various programming languages such as Python, Java, and C. My goal is to develop practical software solutions that solve common problems people face in their day-to-day lives.
### My Projects

       🍝 A recipe manager and calorie tracking app.
